# GatherNow!

Find it hard to explore events that are organized in certain languages as a foreigner living in South Korea? Here is the app to save you! Introducing “GatherNow”, an app that allows you to create your own events, varying from sports events to cultural exchange sessions, and can especially specify the language that will be used during the events. Also, you can browse the events organized by other users and join the events that you are interested in or feel comfortable with. Of course, Koreans who are also familiar with or would like to learn more about the specific language can join the related events as well!
