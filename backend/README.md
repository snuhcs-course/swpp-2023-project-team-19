# Backend

## Project Structure

The structure of backend project includes these files 

```
backend/
    manage.py
    backend/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
    requirements.txt
    users/
        migrations
        __init__.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        tests.py
```

These files are:
- The outer backend/ root directory is a container for your project. 
- The inner backend/ directory is the actual Python package for this project. Its name is the Python package name you must use when importing anything from it, like backend.urls.
- The inner backend/user directory is the Django app direcotry for managing users.
- `manage.py` is a command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. The detailed could be refered via [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/django-admin/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/django-admin/)
- `backend/init.py`: This is an empty file that informs Python that this directory should be recognized as a Python package.
- `backend/settings.py`: This file contains the settings and configuration for your Django project. 
- `backend/urls.py`: This file contains the URL declarations for your Django project, essentially serving as a "table of contents" for your Django-powered site. For further information on URLs, you can consult the URL dispatcher documentation.
- `backend/wsgi.py`: This file serves as an entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers to host your project.
- `requirements.txt`: This file specifies dependencies of the backend project. This file is automatically generated by `pip freeze > requirements.txt` 


## Installation 
Some necessary libraries should be installed as prerequisite if it is still missing on the new server
```
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
sudo apt install python3-virtualenv
sudo python -m pip install Pillow
```


To install the necessary libraries for this project from PyPI:
```
virtualenv ~/project-virt
source ~/project-virt/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Connecting with Database
`backend/backend/settings.py` is already configured the setting for connecting our Django backend with our mySQL server. Because project is public, so USER and PASSWORD is currently hidden, please type the USER and PASSWORD when making deployment.

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [''] # Need to add server IP address

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'dbgathernow',
        'USER': '', # Please type own DB username here
        'PASSWORD': '', # Please type own DB password here
        'HOST': 'dbgathernow.mysql.database.azure.com',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
```

## Migrating Database
### Make Migration
python3 manage.py makemigrations users
python3 manage.py makemigrations events

### Migrate

python3 manage.py migrate events


## Run server
